### Description
This is a proof-of-concept for detecting malware inside PE headers and Yara rules as features for the executable file. There are 7 Machine learning models for detection, each one is independent from the others. The final decision from the 7 models is calculated with majority voting while each model has its own weight. there is a simple GUI for showing the result and simulating the client environment.
